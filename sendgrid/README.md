### Plugin Installation

		wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/sendgrid/sendgrid.py
		wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/sendgrid/sendgrid.cfg


- Execute the below command with appropriate arguments to check for the valid JSON output:

		python sendgrid.py  --api_key=<api_key>
  
- Then place the configurations in the sendgrid.cfg file.

		[account_1]
		api_key=<api_key>

		[account_1]
		api_key=<api_key>
  
		[account_2]
		api_key=<api_key>
