Plugin for Elasticsearch Monitoring
===========

Install and configure the Elasticsearch plugin to monitor the open source, distributed document store and search engine. It depends strongly on Apache Lucene, a full text search engine in Java. Keep a pulse on the performance of the Elasticsearch environment to ensure you are up to date with the internals of your working cluster.

## Prerequisites

- Download and install the latest version of the [Site24x7 Linux agent](https://www.site24x7.com/app/client#/admin/inventory/add-monitor) in the server where you plan to run the plugin. 

---


### Plugin Installation  

- Create a directory named "elasticsearchnodes".
- Download all the files in the "elasticsearchnodes" folder and place it under the "elasticsearchnodes" directory.

		wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/elasticsearchnodes/elasticsearchnodes.cfg
		wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/elasticsearchnodes/elasticsearchnodes.py

- Follow the steps in [this article](https://support.site24x7.com/portal/en/kb/articles/updating-python-path-in-a-plugin-script-for-linux-servers) to update the Python path in the elasticsearchnodes.py script.
		
- Since it's a python plugin, to run in windows server please follow the steps given [here](https://support.site24x7.com/portal/en/kb/articles/run-python-plugin-scripts-in-windows-servers), remaining configuration steps are exactly the same. 


- Execute the below command with appropriate arguments to check for the valid json output:

		python3 elasticsearchnodes.py --host=<host name> --port=<port no> --node_name=<node name> --username=<elasticsearchnodes username> --password=<elasticsearchnodes password>

### Configurations

- Provide your elasticsearchnodes configurations elasticsearchnodes.cfg file.
```
[elasticsearchcluster]
host= <ELASTICSEARCH_HOST>
port= <ELASTICSEARCH_PORT>
username= <ELASTICSEARCH_USERNAME>
password= <ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD>
node_name= <ELASTICSEARCH_NODE_NAME>
```	

- Move the directory "elasticsearchnodes" under the Site24x7 Linux Agent plugin directory: 

		Linux       ->  /opt/site24x7/monagent/plugins/elasticsearchnodes
		
The agent will automatically execute the plugin within five minutes and user can see the plugin monitor under Site24x7 > Plugins > Plugin Integrations.
