# Plugin for monitoring PrestoDB

This plugin monitors the collection of detailed performance-oriented metrics throughout the life cycle of Presto service and its various components.

### Prerequisites

- Download and install the latest version of the [Site24x7 Linux agent] (https://www.site24x7.com/app/client#/admin/inventory/add-monitor) in the server where you plan to run the plugin.

- Plugin Uses "JPype" python library. This module is used to execute the jmx query and get data. Execute the below command to install python JPype modeule in your server.

      pip install JPype1

- Configure the JMX Port in the etc/config.properties file in the PresodDB installation folder

      jmx.rmiregistry.port=36799

### Plugin installation

---

##### Linux

- Create a directory "prestodb".

- Download all the files in "prestodb" folder and place it under the "prestodb" directory

		wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/prestodb/prestodb.py
		wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/prestodb/prestodb.cfg

- Follow the steps in [this article](https://support.site24x7.com/portal/en/kb/articles/updating-python-path-in-a-plugin-script-for-linux-servers) to update the Python path in the prestodb.py script.

- Configure the host and port of the prestodb to be montiored in prestodb.cfg, as mentioned below

		[display_name]
		host = “<your_host_name>”
		port = “<port number you mentioned in etc/config.properties>”

- Execute the below command with appropriate arguments to check for the valid json output.

		python prestodb.py --host=localhost --port=36799
	      
- Move the directory "prestodb" under Site24x7 Linux Agent plugin directory :

		Linux             ->   /opt/site24x7/monagent/plugins/]

The agent will automatically execute the plugin within five minutes and user can see the plugin monitor under Site24x7 > Plugins > Plugin Integrations.
