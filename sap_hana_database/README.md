# SAP HANA DATABASE MONITORING


### What is SAP HANA ?

SAP HANA (High-performance ANalytic Appliance) is a column-oriented database that stores data in its memory instead of on a disk. This unique architecture enables SAP HANA to process and query massive amounts of data with near-zero latency, which is significantly faster than other database management systems and allows for advanced real-time analytics.
	
Monitor the availability and performance of your SAP HANA database with SAP HANA plugin integration.

### Prerequisites

- Download and install the latest version of the [Site24x7 Linux agent] (https://www.site24x7.com/app/client#/admin/inventory/add-monitor) in the server where you plan to run the plugin.

- Install the hdbcli module with the following command

		pip install hdbcli
		
- hdbcli driver supports for python 2.7, python 3.4 and above.
		
-  Ensure the SAP HANA user profile that will be added in the sap_hana_database.cfg file has been provided public and monitoring role access:

		GRANT ROLE PUBLIC to user <username>
		GRANT ROLE MONITORING to user <username>

### Plugin Installation

- Create a directory named "sap_hana_database".
		
- Download all the files in "sap_hana_database" folder and place it under the "sap_hana_database" directory

		wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/sap_hana_database/sap_hana_database.py
		wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/sap_hana_database/sap_hana_database.cfg

- Follow the steps in [this article](https://support.site24x7.com/portal/en/kb/articles/updating-python-path-in-a-plugin-script-for-linux-servers) to update the Python path in the sap_hana_database.py script.
	
- Add the below configurations in sap_hana_database.cfg file:

		[sap_hana_database]
		host = <hostname>
		port = <port>
		username = <username>
		password = <password>

- Execute the below command with appropriate arguments to check for a valid json output:  

		python sap_hana_database.py --host=<host_name> --port=<port_number> --username=<username> --password=<password> 
		
- To analyze your sap hana database logs and identify the exact root cause of the issues, you can make configuration changes by adding logs_enabled, log_type_name, and log_file_path in sap_hana_database.cfg file

		[sap_hana_database]
		host=<hostname>
		port=<port>
		username=<username>
		password=<password>
		logs_enabled=True
		log_type_name="saphana_log"
		log_file_path="/usr/sap/<SID>/HDB<Instance number>/<hostname>/trace/*.log"
		
 In the above, fill in the System ID, Instance number and hostname with applicable details.
 
- Move the directory "sap_hana_database" under the Site24x7 Linux Agent plugin directory: 

		Linux             ->   /opt/site24x7/monagent/plugins/
 
The agent will automatically execute the plugin within five minutes and user can see the plugin monitor under Site24x7 > Plugins > Plugin Integrations.
