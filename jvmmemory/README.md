Plugin for JVM Memory Monitoring
================================

This plugin can be used to monitor the JVM memory through JMX Monitoring.

### Prerequisites

- Download and install the latest version of the [Site24x7 Linux agent] (https://www.site24x7.com/help/admin/adding-a-monitor/linux-server-monitoring.html#add-linux-server-monitor) in the server where you plan to run the plugin.
