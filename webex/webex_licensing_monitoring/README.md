## Plugin installation  
### Prerequisites  
* WebEx account with Admin and Compliance manager privileges.

1.

This will take you to the "My Apps" page. Click the blue plus at the top right and then choose "Create an Integration". You should now be on the "New Integration" page. Choose a unique name, a contact email (for Cisco internal support use only, it won't be referenced anywhere publicly), an icon, and the general description or purpose of the integration.

    	(D)scopes
    	(E)state

6. Hit the authorization URL from the browser you will need to sign in again to and accept all the privileges being requested by the integration on completion of which will be 	redirected to the page which you have mentioned earlier in redirect_uri. In the url you will be able to find the authorization code[code] along with the URI.

7. To retrieve the Access Token kindly do a HTTP POST to https://webexapis.com/v1/access_token with
		(A) grant_type — This should be set to "authorization_code"
		(B) client_id — Issued when creating your integration
		(C) client_secret — Remember this guy? You kept it safe somewhere when creating your integration.
