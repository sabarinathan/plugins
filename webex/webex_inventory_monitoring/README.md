    	(E)state

6. Hit the authorization URL from the browser you will need to sign in again to and accept all the privileges being requested by the integration on completion of which will be 	redirected to the page which you have mentioned earlier in redirect_uri. In the url you will be able to find the authorization code[code] along with the URI.

7. To retrieve the Access Token kindly do a HTTP POST to https://webexapis.com/v1/access_token with
		(A) grant_type — This should be set to "authorization_code"
