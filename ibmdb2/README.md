# IBM DB2 Monitoring

                                                                                       
## Prerequisites

- Download and install the latest version of the [Site24x7 Linux agent](https://www.site24x7.com/app/client#/admin/inventory/add-monitor) in the server where you plan to run the plugin. 

- Install ibm_db module for python
	```
	  pip install ibm_db
	```
---



### Plugin Installation  

- Create a directory named "ibmdb2".
      
- Download all the files in the "ibmdb2" folder and place it under the "ibmdb2" directory.

		wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/ibm_db2/ibmdb2/ibmdb2.py
		wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/ibm_db2/ibmdb2/ibmdb2.cfg

- Follow the steps in [this article](https://support.site24x7.com/portal/en/kb/articles/updating-python-path-in-a-plugin-script-for-linux-servers) to update the Python path in the ibmdb2.py script.
 
- Execute the below command with appropriate arguments to check for the valid json output:
	```
	 python3 ibmdb2.py --host <hostname> --port <port no> --username <username> --password <password> --sample_db <db name>
	 ```
- Move the folder "ibmdb2" into the Site24x7 Linux Agent plugin directory: 

		Linux             ->   /opt/site24x7/monagent/plugins/ibmdb2 
		
Since it's a python plugin, to run in windows server please follow the steps in below link, remaining configuration steps are exactly the same.

---

### Configurations

- Provide your IBM MQ configurations in ibmdb2.cfg file.
	```
	  [ibm_db_2]
	  host 	= "<hostname>"
	  port 	= "<port>"
	  username	= "<username>"
	  password 	= "<password>"
	  sample_db	= "<sample_db>"
	```	
		
The agent will automatically execute the plugin within five minutes and send performance data to the Site24x7 data center.
