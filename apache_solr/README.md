Plugin for monitoring Apache Solr 
==============================================

This plugin monitors the collection of detailed performance-oriented metrics throughout the life cycle of Solr service and its various components.

### Prerequisites

- Download and install the latest version of the [Site24x7 Linux agent/Site24x7 Windows agent](https://www.site24x7.com/app/client#/admin/inventory/add-monitor) in the server where you plan to run the plugin. 

- Plugin Uses "JPype" python library. This module is used to execute the jmx query and get data. Execute the below command to install python JPype modeule in your server. 

- Python version must be 3.5 or above.

		pip install JPype1
		
- JMX connection should be enabled in the Apache Solr installation folder. To enable the JMX connection follow the below steps: Open bin/solr.in.sh inside the installation folder of Apache Solr and change the following attributes

		ENABLE_REMOTE_JMX_OPTS=”true”
		RMI_PORT=18983
		

### Plugin installation
---

- Create a directory "apache_solr".

- Download all the files in "apache_solr" folder and place it under the "apache_solr" directory

	  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/apache_solr/apache_solr.py
	  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/apache_solr/apache_solr.cfg
	

- Execute the below command with appropriate arguments to check for the valid json output.  

		python apache_solr.py --host_name=localhost --port=18983 --domain_name=<your_domain_name>

#### Configurations
- Edit apache_solr.cfg with approriate configurations

	```
	[display_name]
	host_name = “<your_host_name>”
	port = “18983”
	domain_name = “<your_domain_name>”
	```
#### Linux

- Follow the steps in [this article](https://support.site24x7.com/portal/en/kb/articles/updating-python-path-in-a-plugin-script-for-linux-servers) to update the Python path in the apache_solr.py script.

- Place the "apache_solr" under the Site24x7 Linux Agent plugin directory:

        Linux    ->   /opt/site24x7/monagent/plugins/apache_solr

#### Windows
- Since it's a Python plugin, to run the plugin in a Windows server please follow the steps in the below link. The remaining configuration steps are the same.
https://support.site24x7.com/portal/en/kb/articles/run-python-plugin-scripts-in-windows-servers
-  Further move the folder "apache_solr" into the  Site24x7 Windows Agent plugin directory:

        Windows          ->   C:\Program Files (x86)\Site24x7\WinAgent\monitoring\Plugins\apache_solr


The agent will automatically execute the plugin within five minutes and user can see the plugin monitor under Site24x7 > Plugins > Plugin Integrations.

	filter_cache_hits -> metric calculate the number of cache hits across filter caches since this node has been running in your Apache Solr Setup. [hit]

	filter_cache_inserts -> metric calculate the number of cache insertions across filter caches since this node has been running in your Apache Solr Setup. [set]

	filter_cache_lookups -> metric calculate the number of cache lookups across filter caches since this node has been running in your Apache Solr Setup. [get]

	query_result_cache_evictions -> metric calculate the number of cache evictions across query result caches since this node has been running in your Apache Solr Setup. [eviction]

	query_result_cache_lookups -> metric calculate the number of cache lookups across query result caches since this node has been running in your Apache Solr Setup. [get]

	query_request_times_50thpercent -> metric calculate the request processing time for the request which belongs to the 50th Percentile. E.g., if 100 requests are received, then the 50th fastest request time will be reported by this statistic. [request]

	query_request_times_75thpercent -> metric calculate the request processing time for the request which belongs to the 75th Percentile. E.g., if 100 requests are received, then the 75th fastest request time will be reported by this statistic. [request]

	query_request_times_99thpercent -> metric calculate the request processing time for the request which belongs to the 99th Percentile. E.g., if 100 requests are received, then the 99th fastest request time will be reported by this statistic. [request]

	query_request_times_mean -> metric calculate the mean of all the request processing time since this node has been running in your Apache Solr Setup. [request/second]
