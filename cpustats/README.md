## Monitoring CPU statistics on a Server

## CPU Statistics plugin installation:
	
* Create a directory with the name "cpustats".

* Download the file "cpustats.py" from our GitHub repository using below command and place it under the "cpustats" directory

		wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/cpustats/cpustats.py

* Follow the steps in [this article](https://support.site24x7.com/portal/en/kb/articles/updating-python-path-in-a-plugin-script-for-linux-servers) to update the Python path in the cpustats.py script.
		
* Execute the plugin script manually using below command to get valid json output

		python cpustats.py
		
* Move the directory "cpustats", under Site24x7 Linux Agent plugin directory - /opt/site24x7/monagent/plugins/cpustats.

* The agent will automatically execute the plugin within five minutes and user can see the plugin monitor under Site24x7 > Plugins > Plugin Integrations.

## Monitored Attributes : All the system listed cpu attributes in top command output. 

	user_percentage : % CPU time spent in user space
	system_percentage :  % CPU time spent in kernel space
	nicetime_percentage : % CPU time spent on low priority processes
	idle_percentage : % CPU time spent idle
	iowait_percentage : % CPU time spent in wait (on disk)
	hardwareirq_percentage : % CPU time spent servicing/handling hardware interrupts
	software_irq : % CPU time spent servicing/handling software interrupts
	steal_time : % CPU time in involuntary wait by virtual cpu while hypervisor is servicing another processor
