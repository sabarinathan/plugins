# Nginx Plugin
                                                                                              
## Prerequisites

- Download and install the latest version of the [Site24x7 Linux agent](https://www.site24x7.com/app/client#/admin/inventory/add-monitor) in the server where you plan to run the plugin. 

#### Enable nginx_status to get metrics -

1. Open terminal and run the following command to open NGINX server configuration file.
		 ``` 
		 $sudo vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf 
		 ```
2. Add the following code inside the server block which is present in the "/etc/nginx/nginx.conf" file.
```
location /nginx_status {
    stub_status;
    	
}
```
3. Save and close the /etc/nginx/nginx.conf file.
4. Now restart the nginx to apply the changes :
```bash
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

5. Please test the nginx status url that returns response without error.  

	For Example
	```
	curl http://localhost/nginx_status
	```
 	Response of the command should be similar to the below output.
	
	```
	Active connections: 2
	server accepts handled requests
	344014 344014 661581
	Reading: 0 Writing: 1 Waiting: 1
	```
 **Note :**
	The nginx status url used was default one. In case if you have assigned a domain please use that in the URL accordingly.

## Plugin Installation  

- Once installed the respective agent in the server, create a directory named "nginx".
      
- Download all the files in the "nginx" folder and place it under the "nginx" directory.

		wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/nginx/nginx.py && sed -i "1s|^.*|#! $(which python3)|" nginx.py

  		wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/nginx/nginx.cfg



- Execute the below command with appropriate arguments to check for the valid json output:

		python3 nginx.py --nginx_status_url=<nginx stats url> --username=<nginx username> --password=<nginx password> 

- Once the above command execution given the valid json, further provide the command argument as configurations in nginx.cfg file.

		[nginx]
		plugin_version=1
		heartbeat=true
		nginx_status_url="http://localhost/nginx_status"
		username=None
		password=None
		timeout=60
		logs_enabled = "true"
		log_type_name = "Nginx Logs"
		log_file_path = "/var/log/nginx/access*"
	
- Once the configuration done, move the "nginx" directory under the Site24x7 Linux Agent plugin directory: 

		Linux             ->   /opt/site24x7/monagent/plugins/

		
The agent will automatically execute the plugin within five minutes and user can see the plugin monitor under Site24x7 > Plugins > Plugin Integrations.
