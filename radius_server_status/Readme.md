# RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service)  Server

#### What is RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service)?

RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) is a client-server protocol and software that enables remote access servers to communicate with a central server to authenticate dial-in users and authorise their access to the requested system or service.
RADIUS enables a company to maintain user profiles in a central database that all remote servers can share. Having a central database provides better security, enabling a company to set up a policy that can be applied at a single administered network point.

## Prerequisites: 

- Download and install the latest version of the [Site24x7 Linux agent] (https://www.site24x7.com/app/client#/admin/inventory/add-monitor) in the server where you plan to run the plugin. 

## Installation Steps:


To install the Radius Server Status plugin, please follow these steps:

- Create a directory named "radius_server_status" on your system.

- Download the necessary files and place them inside the "radius_server_status" directory.

  ```
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/radius_server_status/radius_server_status.py
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/radius_server_status/radius_server_status.cfg
  ```

- Follow the steps in [this article](https://support.site24x7.com/portal/en/kb/articles/updating-python-path-in-a-plugin-script-for-linux-servers) to update the Python path in the radius_server_status.py script.

- Execute the below command with appropriate arguments to check for the valid json output:
```
python3 radius_server_status.py --ip=<ip-of-radius-server> --port=<port-no-of-radius-server> --device_password=<shared-secret-key> 
```
  
- Locate and open the downloaded file "radius_server_status.cfg" using a text editor.

- Edit the "radius_server_status.cfg" file and update its contents with the following:

          [Radius Server Status]
          ip = localhost
          port = 1812
          device_password = testing123

- Where,
     - [Radius Server Status] is the name of the monitor. You can change it to a name that suits your requirements.
     - ip is the IP address of your Radius server. Replace "localhost" with the actual IP address of your server.
     - port is the port number used by the Radius server for authentication. Update it if your Radius server uses a different port.
     - device_password is the shared secret key used for authentication between the client and the Radius server. Replace "testing123" with your actual shared secret key.

- Ensure that the IP address, port, and device password match your specific configuration. Modify them if necessary.

After finish the configuration, move the folder "radius_server_status" into the Site24x7 Linux Agent plugin directory:

        radius_server_status  -->  /opt/site24x7/monagent/plugins/



The agent will automatically execute the plugin within five minutes and user can see the plugin monitor under Site24x7 > Plugins > Plugin Integrations.

#### Note:

The Radius Server Status plugin will then send an Access-Request packet to the specified Radius server and monitor the response. If an Access-Accept packet is received, the plugin monitor will be in the "up" state, indicating that the Radius server is online. If there is no response or an Access-Reject packet is received, the monitor will be in the "down" state, indicating that the Radius server is offline.
