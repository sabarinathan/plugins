Plugin for Monitoring Redis Sentinel
==============================================

Redis Sentinel is the high availability solution for open-source Redis server.  In case of a failure in your Redis cluster, Sentinel will automatically detect the point of failure and bring the cluster back to stable mode without any human intervention.

Follow the below steps to configure the Redis Sentinel plugin and to monitor metrics for providing in-depth visibility into the performance, availability, and usage stats of Redis Sentinel.

### Prerequisites

- Download and install the latest version of the [Site24x7 Linux agent] (https://www.site24x7.com/app/client#/admin/inventory/add-monitor) in the server where you plan to run the plugin. 
		

### Plugin installation
---
##### Linux 

- Create a folder "redis_sentinel".

- Download the file in "redis_sentinel" folder and place it under the "redis_sentinel" directory

		wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/redis_sentinel/redis_sentinel.py
		wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/redis_sentinel/redis_sentinel.cfg

- Follow the steps in [this article](https://support.site24x7.com/portal/en/kb/articles/updating-python-path-in-a-plugin-script-for-linux-servers) to update the Python path in the redis_sentinel.py script.

- Execute the below command with appropriate arguments to check for the valid json output. 

		python redis_sentinel.py --port=<PORT_FOR_REDIS_SENTINEL> --master=<MASTER_NAME_TO_MONITOR>

- Provide the below configurations in "redis_sentinel.cfg"

		[DISPLAY_NAME]
		port=<PORT FOR REDIS SENTINEL>
		master=<MASTER NAME TO MONITOR>
		
- Move the folder "redis_sentinel" under Site24x7 Linux Agent plugin directory : 

		Linux            ->   /opt/site24x7/monagent/plugins/

The agent will automatically execute the plugin within five minutes and user can see the plugin monitor under Site24x7 > Plugins > Plugin Integrations.
