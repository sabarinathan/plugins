Plugin for monitoring the KVM host
==================================

Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) is an open source technology that lets you to act your linux as a hypervisor. This plugin is used to monitor the kvm host server to get the details like CPU, memory and other details.  

### Prerequisites

- Download and install the latest version of the [Site24x7 Linux agent] (https://www.site24x7.com/help/admin/adding-a-monitor/linux-server-monitoring.html#add-linux-server-monitor) in the server where you plan to run the plugin. 

- Plugin Uses "libvirt" python library. This module is used for managing virtualization platforms

- How to install libvirt :

		apt-get install libvirt-bin libvirt-doc
		
For more details on the libvirt library , refer https://libvirt.org/index.html. 


### Plugin installation
---
##### Linux 

- Create a directory "kvm_host".

- Download all the files in "kvm_host" folder and place it under the "kvm_host" directory

		wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/kvm_host/kvm_host.py
		wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/kvm_host/kvm_host.cfg

- Follow the steps in [this article](https://support.site24x7.com/portal/en/kb/articles/updating-python-path-in-a-plugin-script-for-linux-servers) to update the Python path in the kvm_host.py script.
			  	
- Configure the keys to be monitored, as mentioned in the below configuration, in "kvm_host.cfg"

		[localhost]
		host="qemu:///system"
		plugin_version="1"
		heartbeat="True"
		
host - KVM host to be monitored.Incase of remote host ssh login details has to be provides.

- Execute the below command with appropriate arguments to check for the valid json output.  

		python kvm_host.py --host "qemu:///system" --plugin-version "1" --heartbeat "True"
		
- Move the directory "kvm_host" under Site24x7 Linux Agent plugin directory - /opt/site24x7/monagent/plugins/


The agent will automatically execute the plugin within five minutes and user can see the plugin monitor under Site24x7 > Plugins > Plugin Integrations.
