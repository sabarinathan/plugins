| author        |  Task's owner.                                    |
| Status        |  Current state of the task                        |
| lastRunTime   |  Previous Datetime of Task Scheduled.             |
| Start_Date    |  Task Started time                                |
| errorCode     |  Error code of Previous Scheduled task.           |

## **Prerequisites**

Download and install the latest version of the [Site24x7 Windows agent] (https://www.site24x7.com/app/client#/admin/inventory/add-monitor) in the server where you plan to run the plugin.

## **Plugin installation**

1. Create a folder "ScheduledTask".

2. Download all the files in "ScheduledTask" folder and place it under the "ScheduledTask" directory.

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/ScheduledTask/ScheduledTask.ps1

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/ScheduledTask/ScheduledTask.cfg
```

3. Modify the ScheduledTask.cfg file with the task name to monitor the particular task.

```
For example:
[Scheduled_task]
taskName=\OfficeSoftwareProtectionPlatform\SvcRestartTask
```

  **NOTE:**
  To fill in the task name in the .cfg file, add the location of the task you want to monitor from the General tab of Windows Task Scheduler followed by    a slash and the task name.


4. To monitor multiple tasks, modify the .cfg file accordingly. 

Here's an example below:

```
[Scheduled_task1]
taskName=\OfficeSoftwareProtectionPlatform\SvcRestartTask

[Scheduled_task2]
taskName=\Microsoft\Windows\AppId\Work Room
```

5. Further move the folder "ScheduledTask" into the  Site24x7 Windows Agent plugin directory:

```
    Windows          ->   C:\Program Files (x86)\Site24x7\WinAgent\monitoring\Plugins\ScheduledTask
```

The agent will automatically execute the plugin within five minutes and user can see the plugin monitor under Site24x7 > Plugins > Plugin Integrations.
