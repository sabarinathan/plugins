# **Kafka Producer Monitoring**

## About Apache Kafka
Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed stream-processing platform developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It is written in Java and Scala, and is used to collect, process, and store real-time data streams. Its core capabilities include high throughput, scalability, and low latency, and it is often used to build stream data pipelines and applications.

## Kafka Producer
Producers are client applications that send data into Kafka broker topics. 
Install the Apache Kafka Producer plugin to monitor key Kafka producer metrics and ensure a steady flow of data.


### Prerequisites
- To enable Kafka Producer JMX port

    Find the following similar code block in the kafka-console-producer.sh script.

        
        if [ "x$KAFKA_HEAP_OPTS" = "x" ]; then
            export KAFKA_HEAP_OPTS="-Xmx512M"
        fi
        
    And paste the following lines below the above code block.

        
        export KAFKA_JMX_OPTS="-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=9998"
        export JMX_PORT=9998
        
- Restart the kafka producer after the above changes.

- Install the jmxquery module for Python3.
    ```
    pip install jmxquery
    ```

- Download and install the latest version of the [Site24x7 Linux agent](https://www.site24x7.com/app/client#/admin/inventory/add-monitor) in the server where you intend  to run the plugin.



### Plugin Installation

- Create a directory named "kafka_producer_monitoring".

- Download all the files in the "kafka_producer_monitoring" folder and place them under the "kafka_producer_monitoring" directory.

- Execute the below command with appropriate arguments to check for the valid json output:
  
        python3 kafka_producer_monitoring.py --kafka_producer_host=<KAFKA_PRODUCER_HOST_NAME> kafka_producer_jmx_port=<KAFKA_PRODUCER_PORT_NO> --kafka_producer_client_id=<KAFKA_PRODUCER_CLIENT_ID> --logs_enabled=False --log_type_name=None --log_file_path=None

- After above command with parameters gives expected output, please configure the relevant  parameters in the kafka_producer_monitoring.cfg file.

        [kafka_producer_1]
        kafka_producer_host=localhost
        kafka_producer_jmx_port=9998
        kafka_producer_client_id=<KAFKA_PRODUCER_CLIENT_ID>
        logs_enabled=False
        log_type_name=None
        log_file_path=None
        


#### Linux

- Follow the steps in [this article](https://support.site24x7.com/portal/en/kb/articles/updating-python-path-in-a-plugin-script-for-linux-servers) to update the Python path in the kafka_producer_monitoring.py script.

- Place the "kafka_producer_monitoring" under the Site24x7 Linux Agent plugin directory:

        Linux    ->   /opt/site24x7/monagent/plugins/kafka_producer_monitoring
  
#### Windows
- Since it's a Python plugin, to run the plugin in a Windows server please follow the steps in the below link. The remaining configuration steps are the same.
https://support.site24x7.com/portal/en/kb/articles/run-python-plugin-scripts-in-windows-servers

-  Further move the folder "kafka_producer_monitoring" into the  Site24x7 Windows Agent plugin directory:

        Windows          ->   C:\Program Files (x86)\Site24x7\WinAgent\monitoring\Plugins\kafka_producer_monitoring



#### Supported Metrics
The following metrics are captured by the Kafka Producer monitoring plugin :

- **Compression Rate Avg**

    The average compression rate of batches sent

- **Response Rate**

    The average number of bytes consumed per second across all topics.
- **Request Rate**

    The average number of requests sent per second

- **Request Latency Avg**

    The average request latency
- **Outgoing Byte Rate**

    The average number of outgoing/incoming bytes per second
- **IO Wait Time NS Avg**

    The average length of time the I/O thread spent waiting for a socket
- **Batch Size Avg**

    The average number of bytes sent per partition per request
- **Client ID**

    Client ID Name
